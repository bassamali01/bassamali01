Hi there!

My name's Bassam Razzaq. I am a Bauer Honors senior majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Supply-Chain Management (SCM) with a concentration in Strategic Sourcing and Data Analytics. I will be graduating in Fall of 2021.

Currently, I am looking to expand my knowledge in data analysis. I've been taking a few courses and learned a few languages (Python, R, Lingo) that I will be using to turn into projects very soon. I've already worked on a few projects that will be posted on my repository. 


In addition, I've also had the opportunity to participate in my first hackathon ever, HackMISSO. We were given two days to choose a prompt, come up with a project design, make the project, and present it. Our idea was to create a website that tracks daily activities that will positively impact our bodies, allowing users to keep up with their mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health during the pandemic. Having a little-to-no technical background, we had to learn on the fly, not only to code the front-end and also to design the back-end. Personally, working with databases and Microsoft Azure was a great learning experience for me!

I am very proud to say that our team placed 2nd place at our first Hackathon!
